        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which can be thought of as real-world things or abstract entities. Each object contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   Data (called attributes or properties), and\n",
        "    *   Behavior (called methods or functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "  - It defines the structure and behavior of objects of a specific type, including their attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
        "  - Classes enable code reuse, modularity, and organization, making it easier to manage complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental unit that combines data (attributes or fields) with the actions or behaviors that can be performed on that data (methods or functions).\n",
        "  - It's essentially an instance of a class, a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects of that type.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), abstraction focuses on simplifying complex systems by showing only essential details, while encapsulation bundles data and methods within a unit (like a class) and restricts access to some parts of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods in Python, also known as magic or special methods, are predefined methods with double underscores ( __ ) at the beginning and end of their names.\n",
        "  - They allow you to customize the behavior of your objects and make them interact seamlessly with Python's built-in operators and functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a mechanism where a new class (derived or subclass) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (base or superclass).\n",
        "  - This promotes code reuse, hierarchical relationships, and allows for creating new classes that build upon existing ones, adding or modifying functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling them to respond to the same method call in different ways. This provides flexibility and code reusability, allowing multiple classes to implement the same method with unique behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, encapsulation, a core object-oriented programming concept, is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class, and then controlling access to these attributes and methods using access modifiers (public, protected, and private).\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, a constructor is a special method, typically named __init__, that's automatically called when a new object of a class is created.\n",
        "  - It's used to initialize the attributes of that object with specific values.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, a static method is a function within a class that doesn't have access to the class or instance state, while a class method is bound to the class itself (accessed via the class name) and receives the class as its first argument (cls).\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
        "  - Method overloading, in essence, allows defining multiple methods within a class that share the same name but have different parameter lists or signatures.\n",
        "  - Python, however, doesn't directly support conventional method overloading like some other languages (e.g., Java).\n",
        "  - Instead, it achieves the same effect through flexible argument handling techniques like default arguments, variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs), and conditional logic within the function.\n",
        "  - This approach provides versatility and reduces code duplication, allowing developers to handle various input scenarios with a single function.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method overriding is a mechanism where a subclass provides its own specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "  - This allows subclasses to customize the behavior of inherited methods while maintaining the same method signature as the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        "  - The property decorator lets you define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes — without calling them like a method.\n",
        "  - It's part of Python's getter/setter mechanism, but in a much cleaner, more elegant way.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is crucial in OOP because it allows you to treat objects of different classes as objects of a common type, enabling code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility.\n",
        "  - This means you can write code that works with multiple types of objects using a single interface, simplifying development and maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "  -  In Python, an abstract class is a blueprint for other classes that cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
        "  - It's designed to be subclassed, and it may contain abstract methods (methods with declarations but no implementations) that must be implemented in any concrete class that inherits from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
        "  - **Advantages of OOP:**\n",
        "    1.   Modularity\n",
        "    2.   Reusability\n",
        "    3.   Scalability\n",
        "    4.   Maintainability\n",
        "    5.   Encapsulation\n",
        "    6.   Abstraction\n",
        "    7.   Polymorphism\n",
        "    8.   Improved Collaboration\n",
        "    9.   Real-world Modeling\n",
        "    10.  Code Readability\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
        "  - The main difference between a class variable (also known as a static variable) and an instance variable is their scope and how they are shared among instances of a class. A class variable is shared by all instances of the class, meaning there's only one copy, while each instance of the class has its own separate copy of an instance variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, multiple inheritance allows a class (the child class) to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "  - This means a child class can inherit properties from more than one base class, combining their functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__ str __ ’ and ‘__ repr __’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "  - In Python, __ str __ and __ repr __ are special methods that control how objects are represented as strings. __ str __ provides a human-readable, informal string representation, primarily used for display to end-users.\n",
        "  - __ repr __ provides a more formal, unambiguous representation, often including details useful for debugging or recreating the object.\n",
        "  - If __ str __ is not defined, the interpreter falls back to using __ repr __.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python ?\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is crucial for implementing inheritance and facilitating code reuse within class hierarchies.\n",
        "  - It enables a subclass to access and invoke methods of its parent class, allowing for both extending and overriding inherited behavior.\n",
        "  - By using super(), you avoid having to explicitly name the parent class, making your code more flexible and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __ del __ method in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, the __ del __() method is a destructor that's automatically called by the garbage collector when an object's reference count reaches zero, signaling that the object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "  - It's primarily used for cleaning up resources or performing final actions before an object is deallocated, though its reliability can be affected by the garbage collector's timing.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, @classmethod binds a method to the class, allowing access to the class itself (via cls), while @staticmethod defines a method that belongs to the class but doesn't have access to either the class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        "  - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance works through method overriding, where child classes can redefine methods inherited from parent classes, allowing the same method name to have different implementations based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python allows you to call multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code, improving readability and conciseness.\n",
        "  - It's achieved by having methods return the object itself (usually self), allowing subsequent method calls to be chained using the dot notation.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __ call __ method in Python ?\n",
        "  - he purpose of the __ call __ method in Python is to make instances of a class callable, allowing them to be invoked like functions.\n",
        "  - When you define a __ call __ method within a class, you enable instances of that class to be called using parentheses, as if they were functions."
